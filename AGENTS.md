# AGENTS.md

This repository includes AI‑agent oriented documentation under `docs/agents/`.

## Required agent behavior
- Read `docs/agents/README.md` before making changes.
- Any change to code, tests, scripts, or architecture **must** be reflected in the agent docs.
- Keep the docs in `docs/agents/` synchronized with the actual structure and behavior.

If you update functionality, also update the relevant crate doc and the global overview.
